**My Understanding of PDC (Patient Doctor Connect)**
- **What** - 
	- **Platform** - It is a platform which will remotely monitor a Patient's vitals. 
	- **Provider** - The term used for hospitals and clinics.
	- **POP** -  The person(Doctor, Nurse, Dietitian etc) who is primarily responsible for taking care of a specific patient.
	- **PCP** - The family physician who sees the patient regularly, takes care of general health issues, and refers the patient to the relevant specialist, when needed.
	- **Specialist** - The personnel (Cardiologists/Neurologists) who are associated with the patients for specific consultations and evaluations.
	- **Types of Notes** :-
		1. **Reading Notes** - Added to the patients device readings by POP or Nurses.
		2. **Call Notes** - Added after taking call with the patient by POP or Nurses.
		3. **General Notes** - Added if some important point needs to be highlighted or for a discussion by POP, Nurses and Admins.
		4. **Alert Notes** - Added if any modifications are made to the patient's personalized alerts by POP and Nurses.
		5. **Internal Notes** - 
		6. **Billing Notes** - 
- **How** - The monitoring will be done by a device that will be sent to patients by PDC. The device will keep transmitting  the data to a cloud server.  There is also going to be an **Alerts Systems**. Alerts will be triggered to notify the **POP** and other specified **Personnel** that the vitals of the patient are **abnormal**. The web portal will fetch this data from the cloud and display it in a meaningful format.
	- There will be 4  Portals*(Web Apps)* :-
		1. **PDC Admin Portal** - A web app for the PDC Primary admin/Admins & staff to manage the platform and also support for billing & nursing services.
		2. **Provider Admin Portal** - A responsive Web app for the Providers (clinic) to monitor and manage their patientâ€™s health data remotely).
		3. **Primary Ordering Provider Portal** - A responsive web app for the respective users to access and manage patient health data remotely.
