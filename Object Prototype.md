- Prototypes contain the **inherited properties**
- Objects created from the **same constructor function** share the **same Prototype object**
- **Prototype Chaining** - If a property(being accessed) is **not found** in the object, then it is **searched** in the **object's prototype object**. If the property is still not found, it is **searched recursively** inside the **nested prototypes** objects.
