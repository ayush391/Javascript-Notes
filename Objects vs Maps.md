- **Elements** are **ordered in a Map** while there are **unordered in Objects**.
- Since the elements are ordered in a **Map**, it is **iterable** easily. Whereas for **Objects** we have to first get the list of all the keys to iterate through the Object.
- A key in a **Map** can be a **function, object, symbol, string**. Whereas in an **Object**, a key can only be a **string**. 
- The **size** of a **Map** can be accessed directly by reading the ***size*** property. Whereas for an **Object**, we need to **calculate the size manually**.
