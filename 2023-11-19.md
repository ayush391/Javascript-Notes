**My Understanding of PDC (Patient Doctor Connect)**
- **What** - It is a platform which will remotely monitor a Patient's vitals. 
- **How** - The monitoring will be done by a device that will be sent to patients by PDC. The device will keep transmitting  the data to a cloud server.  The web portal will fetch this data from the cloud and display it in a meaningful format.
