**My Understanding of PDC (Patient Doctor Connect)**
- **What** - It is a platform which will remotely monitor a Patient's vitals. 
- **How** - The monitoring will be done by a device that will be sent to patients by PDC. The device will keep transmitting  the data to a cloud server.  There is also goingThe web portal will fetch this data from the cloud and display it in a meaningful format.
	- There will be 4  Portals*(Web Apps)* :-
		1. **PDC Admin Portal** - A web app for the PDC Primary admin/Admins & staff to manage the platform and also support for billing & nursing services.
		2. **Provider Admin Portal** - A responsive Web app for the Providers (clinic) to monitor and manage their patientâ€™s health data remotely).
		3. **Primary Ordering Provider Portal** - A responsive web app for the respective users to access and manage patient health data remotely.
		4. **Patient Portal** - A responsive web app for the patients to access their data remotely.
